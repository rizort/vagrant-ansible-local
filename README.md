# vagrant-ansible-local-template

Learning Vagrant + Ansible. On a Windows PC.

Which pretty much requires Ansible to run on the Vagrant VM as Ansible is not supported as controlling host. Which in turn is fine 
because the whole idea of using a Vagrant box is not to rely on a messy or crippled (Windows) local development environment.

Anyway, this repo is a work-in-progress template that sort of works for me. Comments and feedback are welcome.
