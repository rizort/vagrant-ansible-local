# vagrant-ansible-local-template

Learning Vagrant + Ansible. On a Windows PC.
Which pretty much requires Ansible to run on the Vagrant Linux VM because Windows is not supported as the controlling host. Which in turn is fine 
because the whole idea of using a Vagrant box is not to rely on a messy or crippled (Windows) local development environment anyway.

It also installs the Ansible Galaxy roles locally. No need to have them prior to vagrant up.

## Dependencies

- VirtualBox
- Vagrant

## Installation

```
1. vagrant up
```

This repo is a work-in-progress template that sort of works for me. Comments and feedback are welcome.
